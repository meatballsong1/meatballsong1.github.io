As of today, 16th of June, at 7:42 PM CDT I hearby close Lab Q Studios It's been a fun inactive ride, not much has happened and I'm considering on working on other projects that are worth my time. That doesn't mean the tech of this game will go to waste though, I hope I can keep working on the game itself to be used in other groups (integrating brick hill & roblox) would be most likely my next project after I get Talk Hangout running. It's been quite cool working with the people I have and getting a feel for teamwork and developing with colleagues for the first time. I plan to use this experience to get better at developing and working with people as well.
